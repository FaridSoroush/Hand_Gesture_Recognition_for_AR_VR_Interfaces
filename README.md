# Hand_Gesture_Recognition_for_AR_VR_Interfaces
Gesture recognition developed using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The project aims to accurately identify hand gestures from static images, focusing on the classic gestures of rock, paper, and scissors. This application is a stepping stone towards recognition tasks in AR/VR environments.
